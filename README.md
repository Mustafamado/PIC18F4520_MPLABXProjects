# PIC18F4520-MPLABXProjects
This repository contains several MPLABX Projects and some libraries to understand how to use a specific PIC18F4520 Development Board. This development board is designed by me and it is currently used in EEX 237 - Introduction to Microprocesses course of Fatih University, Istanbul, Turkey. I am the responsible Teaching Assistant of this course.

Aim of sharing these projects is reaching to and developing the projects easier by my students and people who may be interested.
